# Binary-Tree
Binary Tree Traversal &amp; Nodes Count,  Creating Binary Tree &amp; Searching the Level of the Node 

* Binary Tree Traversal & Nodes Counting  二叉树的遍历、叶子节点的计算

To realize the three traversal of the binary tree:

Preorder Traversal  前序遍历

Inorder Traversal 中序遍历

Postorder Traversal 后序遍历

To count the nodes of the binary tree you build

* Creating Binary Tree & Searching the Level of the Node  构造二叉树、求值为X的结点的层数 

To construct binary tree from preorder and postorder traversal

To find out the level of the node with the specific value
